-----Simulation(E)-----

========================

## The distribution of 5 dice ranges from sum = 5 ~ 9

## The distribution of 20 dice ranges from sum = 25 ~ 37

## The simulation result shows the width of distribution increase with the increasing number of dice. The results agree with the binomial distribution, as the number of trials increase, the width of the distribution increases.
